# Coinzy — AI-Based Coin Identification & Collection App

Coinzy is an AI-powered mobile application that helps users identify unknown coins, understand their attributes and estimated value, and manage or trade collections without requiring expert knowledge. The product is designed for high-intent users who want quick answers and trustworthy results with minimal effort.

This case study focuses on product discovery, onboarding experience, activation, and metrics-driven decision making.

## Problem Statement

Users discovering old or unfamiliar coins often struggle to:
- Identify coins accurately without expert help
- Understand whether a coin is valuable or common
- Trust AI-based identification results
- Reach value quickly without complex onboarding

Coin identification is a **high-intent, low-patience** task. Any delay before the first successful identification increases drop-off and reduces trust.

## Key User Persona

**The Accidental Archivist**  
A busy individual who unexpectedly discovers old coins and wants to quickly identify valuable items without risking the loss of rare heirlooms or wasting time on complex research.

Primary needs:
- Fast identification
- Confidence in results
- Clear value estimation
- Minimal setup before first use

## Core Product Goal

Deliver immediate value by enabling users to confidently identify their first coin within seconds of opening the app, before asking for registration or payment.

## Product Discovery & Insights

### Observed Issues
- Excessive onboarding steps before the first identification
- Unclear distinction between guest and premium access
- Premium prompts appearing before value is demonstrated
- Lack of retry or correction flows when AI results are inaccurate
- Inconsistent trust indicators in identification outputs

### Why This Matters
- Delayed access to core value increases drop-off
- Ambiguity around access rules reduces user trust
- Lack of transparency weakens willingness to convert or engage further

## Proposed Product Improvements

- Simplify onboarding to allow immediate coin identification
- Clearly communicate guest vs premium access boundaries
- Introduce trust indicators for AI results
- Add retry and correction flows for inaccurate or low-confidence outputs
- Reduce friction before first successful identification

## Success Metrics

The following metrics were defined to evaluate impact:

### Activation
- Percentage of users completing their first successful identification
- Time to first identification

### Trust
- Retry or correction interaction rate
- Save-to-collection rate after identification

### Monetization
- Guest to registered user conversion
- Premium conversion after first identification

### Retention
- Percentage of users returning within 7 or 30 days
- Average number of coins saved per returning user

## 30-Day Execution Plan (High-Level)

**Week 1**
